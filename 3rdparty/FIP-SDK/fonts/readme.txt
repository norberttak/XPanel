This folder contains the bitmap font image generated by 
http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/


If you want to create your own fonts, follow these steps:

1. bmfont program creates a PNG image that need to convert to a 24bit BMP
format. You can do it with your favorit image editor.

2. bmfont program also generates an .fnt file that holds the position and size of each charachters in the image.
I created a python script (convert.py) that converts these info into a C header file
(fip-fonts.h) that will be used by the xpanel plugin.

3. Once you created the new FipFonts.h copy it to the src folder and recompile
the plugin. Put the fip-fonts.bmp file to the install folder of the plugin.
